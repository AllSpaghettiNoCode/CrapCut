CrapCut allows you to download any CapCut TTS voices (Pro included) for free by just listening to a sample of it. Simply add some text, pick the voice you want and click the preview button, then click the "Download Sample" button. It's that easy! **No server.py or any other external files needed!**
## Features

- Pro and free voice download.
- Ability to download last saved voice if you accidentally refresh the page.
- 100% free, no paywalls or malicious code.
## Installation

Download latest release (or zip).

Visit the following:

For Chrome:

```bash

Click on the "Developer Mode" switch, this should give you access to load an unpacked extension. Navigate to the folder where you have the zip installed (should have manifest.json) and select the folder. The extension part of the installation is done.
## FAQ

#### Is this against CapCut TOS? Will I get banned?

Everyone hates how CapCut puts the best voices behind paywalls, and people that I've talked to have used tools such as OBS to bypass this and CapCut doesnt seem to care, so no, you will not get banned.


#### Is this actually free? There really isnt anything extra I have to do to use this?

Yep, this is 100% free to use and no extra support is needed or required. I make these to make people happy, not to extort people for money or a rating on a site for clout :)

## Support

There are some bugs present in this extension, but I'm trying to iron them out as fast as I can. If you do have bugs, open an issue and send the error and a screenshot if possible.
